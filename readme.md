# Partial Distribution Matching via Partial Wasserstein Adversarial Networks


This is the official implement of the partial domain adaptation method proposed in [Partial Distribution Matching via
Partial Wasserstein Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10499). 
This approach applies a PWAN model to partial domain adaptation problems.
Also see the application of PWAN in point set registration in our earlier [work](https://openreview.net/forum?id=2ggNjUisGyr) 
([Code](https://github.com/wzm2256/PWAN))

### How does it work?
A classifier is used to extract features and predict labels,
while a PWAN model is used to align the source features to a fraction of the reference features.

An example of the T-SNE visualization of the reference (blue) and source features (red).
Gray points represent outlier features.

### Requirement
- torch=1.12
- matplotlib
- tqdm
- scikit-learn
- tensorboard

### Usage
#### Data perparation

1. **OfficeHome**
   1. Download the dataset from the [official website](https://www.hemanthdv.org/officeHomeDataset.html) to `data/OfficeHome`
   2. Rename the folder of ``real world``  to `Real_World` 

2. **ImageNet**: 
   1. Download the ImageNet dataset (`ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar`) from the [official website](https://www.image-net.org/download.php) to `data/ImageNetCaltech`.
   2. Uncompress the ImageNet dataset to a `train/` folder. 

3. **DomainNet** and **VisDa17** can be downloaded automatically. If the link expires, please also use the official websites.


#### Script
The main script is `PWANN.py`.
We also provide a convinient script `run_all.py` for running this script with different dataset and random seeds.
Commands for reproducing the results in the paper are provided in `a.txt`


The visualization and summary code is provided in `Plot` folder.
For example,

```
cd Plot
python vis_tensorboard.py ./LOG/OfficeHome
```
summarize all experiments in OfficeHome folder.




#### Results
There will be some randomness in the results due to random initialization.
We report the results with random seed 0,1,2.

**OfficeHome**:

| seed   | 0 | 1 | 2 |
|--------|-------|-------|----|
| AC	    |0.66 |0.66 |0.62| 
| AP	    |0.86 |0.81 |0.86| 
| AR	    |0.89 |0.90 |0.90| 
| CA	    |0.78 |0.77 |0.76| 
| CP	    |0.77 |0.74 |0.80| 
| CR	    |0.83 |0.84 |0.87| 
| PA	    |0.79 |0.75 |0.79| 
| PC	    |0.64 |0.63 |0.63| 
| PR	    |0.87 |0.86 |0.87| 
| RA	    |0.80 |0.79 |0.80| 
| RC	    |0.66 |0.66 |0.68| 
| RP	    |0.86 |0.86 |0.89| 
| Avg   |0.784|0.772|0.791|

**VisDa17**: The accuracy ranges from 80 to 92.
The large variance is due to the ambiguity of the `skateboard` and `knife` class.
Visualization and discussion can be found in the appendix of the paper.
